 * Thor stores Configuration File instances in it's tree as large string objects, or as a file.
 * The main idea is that instead of providing a brand new Configuration type, the <code>ConfigurationFile</code>
 * class is sufficient as the parsing tool for the configuartion syntax. Instead, a way to locate the file within Thor is required
